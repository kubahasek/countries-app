## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode _(optional)_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Remix](https://remix-run/) - Full-Stack JS Framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

Main learning point was fetching data and also implementing the theme switcher

### Continued development

If I ever decide to perfect this, I'd make it so that the page keeps the dark mode state over refreshes/the actual user.

## Acknowledgments

I'd like to thank Emil Bryggare from the Remix Discord community who helped me get through an issue with fetching from the API twice, depending on the data from the first fetch.
